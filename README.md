# Personal Portfolio Project

### This Codecademy project was designed to bring together CSS,  HTML, and Vanilla Javascript into one page. The design and content were entirely up to me, but the requirements included:


- Build a website using HTML, CSS
- Add at least one interactive feature using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use the command line and file navigation
- Develop locally on your computer
- Deploy your site to the web using GitHub Pages


#### What I learned:

I used FlexBox and was pleased to see how quickly the layout came together. I honestly had the most problem figuring out how to style the page - it seems a little more high pressure when it's supposed to be your own page that shows off your coding stuff. I learned about some new CSS properties and learned more about CSS animations. 

This was my first time incorporating JavaScript into a page - I was pretty excited about it, though look forward to learning more about how to streamline the code. I was having issues creating multiple Event Listeners on the pink mouse icon, so I ended up creating to separate icons (alternating their opacity so that only one appears on the screen at any given time).
